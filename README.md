# SmartBuylist

## Problem
Create a shared buylist for groups of friends and possibly sync it with different
group expenses apps using their public api.

## Use case
Use case: In the shared room I share with two other people we use splitwise to track
group expenses and make things easier for use (we barely have cash all the time). Usually, when
we go shopping, we don't know or we can't remember what needs we have in the room (maybe we are
running out of toiler paper, maybe we are out of salt or soap). We contanty find each other
text messaging other group members to check these out. With this app, we make those things easier
and we can use Splitwise's API in order to sync the expenses.

## Usage
Open the app, touch the group for whom you want to find the buylist, check an item as buyed
and update it's price. Then, we automatically add that expense to the corresponding spliwise group
and we will make that transaction.
